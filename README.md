I decided to make a program that will utilize logic to create truth tables.

My Goals are:

Create a working truth table generator.
Have an app open seperate from the command line to have ease of use and visuals. (Will use SFML)
Learn to use Git effectively through this project.
(Have fun)
Currently Implemented:

Base truth table generation. i.e.: The ability to take in a set amount of variable and create the basic True False table from them.
A degree of modularity. i.e.: Uses vectors so the tables are able to be appended to once calculations are done.
